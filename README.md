#### About this project
> This project was started as a way to reduce redundant code in some of my personal Web projects and other tools.
> The projects I've found most useful or fun are the database marshaler/un-marshaler and the pipeline projects, check them out!
> Also, feel free to contribute or just tell me how useless some of these things are! 
> I'm always looking for feedback and would love to continue improving!
